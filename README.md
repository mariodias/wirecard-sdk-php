## Installation
Run the command to install via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```SHELL
> composer require mariodias/wirecard-sdk-php
```

## Authenticating and configuring the environment

The authentication is done through the accessToken, [click here](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#1-criar-um-app) for information on how to generate your accessToken.
You will need your token and key to create the APP, so to access your token and test key, [click here](https://conta-sandbox.wirecard.com/configurations/api_credentials).
In addition to configuring your authentication, you must also configure your environment (production or sandbox).

```PHP
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Wirecard\Wirecard;
use Wirecard\Connect;
use Wirecard\Instances;

$accessToken = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_v2";

$client = new Connect($accessToken, Wirecard::SANDBOX);
```

After defining the authentication and the environment, you should instantiate the classes:

```PHP
$api = new Instances($client);
```

## Wirecard accounts

In this topic we separate all the information regarding the Wirecard Accounts as creation / query of account and request of permission of access to the users. In addition, in this section you have all the information you need to manage the transactions of users associated with your marketplace.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Accounts](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#classical-account-on-boarding)

#### Verifying if the user already has Wirecard Account

The search is done through the user's email.

```PHP
$resource = $api->accounts();

$account = $resource->checkExistence(“darth.vader@deathstar.io”);
```
The callback can be:

http = 200 —> The account exists;<br>
http = 404 —> The account don’t exists.

#### Create Wirecard account

```PHP
$resource = $api->accounts();

$data = [  
   "email"=>[  
      "address"=>"seller@email.io"
   ],
   "person"=>[  
      "name"=>"Seller name",
      "lastName"=>"Seller last name",
      "taxDocument"=>[

         "city"=>"São Paulo",
         "state"=>"SP",
         "country"=>"BRA"
      ]
   ],
   "type"=>"MERCHANT"
];

$account = $resource->create($data);

print_r($account);
```

#### Get data from a Wirecard account

```PHP
$resource = $api->accounts();

$account_id = "MPA-XXXXXXXXX”;

$account = $resource->get($account_id);

Print_r($account);
```

#### Get public key from a Wirecard account

You must authenticate with the accessToken of the account that you want to get the public key to use this method.

```PHP
$resource = $api->accounts();

$publicKey = $resource->getPublicKey();

print_r($publicKey);
```

## Customers

The customer is the user of a service or the buyer of your online store. This API allows the registration and consultation of a particular client.

## Orders

The Order is the representation of the shopping cart of your site. This API makes it possible to create, query and list orders.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Orders](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#2-pedidos)

#### Create order
```PHP
$resource = $api->orders();

$data = [
  "ownId"=> "order_ownId",
  "amount"=> [
    "currency"=> "BRL",
    "subtotals"=> [
      "shipping"=> 15000
    ]
  ],
  "items"=> [
    [
      "product"=> "Go Pro Hero7",
      "category"=> "CAMERAS",
      "quantity"=> 1,
      "detail"=> "Photo camera, model hero 7, color black",
      "price"=> 280000
    ]
  ],
  "customer"=> [
    "ownId"=> "customer_ownId",
    "fullname"=> "Customer name",
    "email"=> "customer@email.io",
    "birthDate"=> "1980-05-15",

      "streetNumber"=> 654,
      "complement"=> 12,
      "district"=> "Centro",
      "city"=> "Sao Paulo",

#### List all orders
```PHP
$resource = $api->orders();

$orders = $resource->getOrders();

print_r($orders);
```

 ## Payments

The Payment is the financial transaction between Customer and Receiver (you!), Whether through a credit card, a bank slip, or other means of payment. This API allows the creation, consultation and listing of payments.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Payments](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#3-pagamentos)

To increase transaction security, the Wirecard API works with the concept of end-to-end encryption. That is, sensitive credit card data is encrypted in client applications (browser, native apps) and is only decrypted on Wirecard servers. This is important to prevent your buyer from being exposed to interception of the message. For more information about the credit card hash, visit our documentation: [Credit card hash](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#criptografia-1)

 #### Create payment (Credit card)
 ```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$data = [
  "installmentCount"=> 1,
  "statementDescriptor"=> "your store name",
  "fundingInstrument"=> [
    "method"=> "CREDIT_CARD",
    "creditCard"=> [
      "hash"=> "HhL0kbhfid+jwgj5l6Kt9EPdetDxQN8s7uKUHDYxDC/XoULjzik44rSda3EcWuOcL17Eb8JjWc1JI7gsuwg9P0rJv1mJQx+d3Dv1puQYz1iRjEWWhnB1bw0gTvnnC/05KbWN5M8oTiugmhVK02Rt2gpbcTtpS7VWyacfgesBJFavYYMljYg8p2YGHXkXrMuQiOCeemKLk420d0OTMBba27jDVVJ663HZDrObnjFXJH/4B5irkj+HO5genV+V4PYoLcOESG4nrI3oFAsMGsLLcdJo0NNvkEmJpn0e9GzureKKFYisYU+BEd9EMr/odS0VMvOYRV65HbPTspIkjl2+3Q==",
      "store"=> true,
      "holder"=> [
        "fullname"=> "Card holder name",
        "birthdate"=> "1988-12-30",
        "taxDocument"=> [
          "type"=> "CPF",
          "number"=> "33333333333"
        ],
        "phone"=> [
          "countryCode"=> "55",
          "areaCode"=> "11",
          "number"=> "888888888"
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ];

$payment = $resource->create($order_id, $data);

print_r($payment);
```

#### Create payment (Bank slip)

```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$data = [  
   "statementDescriptor"=>"Your store name",
   "fundingInstrument"=>[  
      "method"=>"BOLETO",
      "boleto"=>[  
         "expirationDate"=>"2020-06-20",
         "instructionLines"=>[  
            "first"=>"Attention,",
            "second"=>"Be aware of the ticket due date.",
            "third"=>"Pay at any bank."
         ],
         "logoUri"=>"http=>//www.yourlogo.io/logo.jpg"
      ]
   ]
];

$payment = $resource->create($order_id, $data);

print_r($payment);
```
#### Create payment (Online debit)

**Important** - For now this form of payment can only be used with Itaú bank, code 341.

```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$data = [  
   "fundingInstrument"=>[  
      "method"=>"ONLINE_BANK_DEBIT",
      "onlineBankDebit"=>[  
         "bankNumber"=>341,
         "expirationDate"=>"2022-11-22"
      ]
   ]
];

$payment = $resource->create($order_id, $data);

print_r($payment);
```

#### Capture pre-authorized payment

The Pre-authorization is a feature that allows you to "reserve" an amount of a customer's card limit for later capture. This can be used to increase anti-fraud analysis time (if you have a tool of your own). Each pre-authorization can be held for up to 5 days and, if the catch does not occur, the payment will be canceled.

This API allows you to capture a payment that is pre-authorized on Wirecard. So you can pre-authorize use the *delayCapture* attribute when creating a payment. You can only capture a payment that has *PRE_AUTHORIZED* status.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Pre-authorization](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#pagamento-pr%C3%A9-autorizado)

```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$payment_id = "PAY-XXXXXXXXXXXX”;

$payment = $resource->capture($payment_id);

print_r($payment);
```

#### Cancel pre-authorized payment
```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$payment_id = "PAY-XXXXXXXXXXXX”;

$payment = $resource->void($payment_id);

print_r($payment);
```

#### Get data from a payment
```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$payment_id = "PAY-XXXXXXXXXXXX”;

$payment = $resource->get($payment_id);

print_r($payment);
```

#### Simulate payments

*You can only simulate payments in the sandbox environment.*

```PHP
$resource = $api->payments();

$payment_id = "PAY-XXXXXXXXXXXX”;
$value = 10000;

$payment = $resource->simulate($payment_id, $value);

print_r($payment);
```

## Multiorders

The Multi-Order is a collection of orders. Used to enable transactions involving orders to different shopkeepers in the same shopping cart. By charging a multi-order with a single consumer interaction, Wirecard generates multiple payments (eg multiple charges on the customer card) and associates with each order, facilitating the management of marketplaces and platforms.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Multiorders](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#4-multipedidos)

#### Create multiorder
```PHP
$resource = $api->multiorders();

$data = [
  "ownId"=> "multiorder_ownId",
  "orders"=> [
    [
      "ownId"=> "order_ownId_1",

## Multipayments

The Multipayment is a collection of payments associated with a multi-order. Used for the implementation of trolleys with more than one shopkeeper and situations where it is necessary to charge differently different items within a single checkout. When you create a multi-pay, Wirecard automatically creates a payment for each order in the multi-order and automatically charges.

In case of credit card, multiple authorizations are generated, one for each payment, separating the charges in the invoice of the customer and with that facilitating the management of the Marketplace or Platform.

## Notifications

The Webhooks are the notifications sent by Wirecard to your system every time your transaction goes through an event and has its status changed. Therefore, through webhooks it is possible to synchronize your system to Wirecard.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Webhooks](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#notifica%C3%A7%C3%B5es)

If you do not have a URL available, you can use a **Webhook Tester** to do your tests and receive the webhooks.

To do this, access this [application](https://webhook.site) and generate a URL automatically.

## Refunds

Is there a problem and need to cancel the purchase for your customer? No problems!

Refund is the return of a payment to the consumer. Through this API you can make refunds and see the details of a certain refund.

For more information about this resource, visit our documentation: [Refunds](https://dev.wirecard.com.br/v2.0/reference#reembolsos-1)

The fundamental difference between a refund and a reimbursement is the form of payment in which the transaction was processed. Transactions processed via credit cards, in the event of cancellation, generate a direct chargeback on the buyer's invoice, transactions made via bank or debit account, generate a refund to Wirecard account or buyer's bank account.

#### Refund payment

```PHP
$resource = $api->refunds();

$payment_id = “PAY-XXXXXXXXXXXX”;

$refund = $resource->refundPayment($payment_id);

print_r($refund);
```

#### Refund order

```PHP
$resource = $api->refunds();

$data = [
  "refundingInstrument"=> [
    "method"=> "BANK_ACCOUNT",

      "bankNumber"=> "001",
      "agencyNumber"=> 4444444,
      "agencyCheckNumber"=> 2,

        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
];

$refund = $resource->create($order_id, $data);

print_r($refund);
```

#### Partially refund a transaction
